# PROTOTYPE - SensorNet Chart

This folder contains the prototyping that was done before the actual [SensorNet Chart]() project was started. The areas where work as been focused are:

* Socket communications - this client sends *history requests* to the server, which responds with the requested data and the query.
* Graphng data - prior to the creation of this prototype several other chart libraries were investigated. At this time [Apex Charts]() provided necessary features, pricing, and documentation.
* Dynamic UI - each sensor is properly named, and is colored specifically so that its data can be recognized in the chart.
